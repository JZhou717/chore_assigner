 * A simple application that assigns chores to my housemates and me for the year. It follows some simple rules and tracks how many times each person has done one of the 4 categories of chores. The data is then serialized so that I do not have to input data everytime I want to make an adjustment to chore assignments.

/*
 * WILL have 3 features
 * 1. View current data, i.e., people and their amounts per chore
 * 2. Compute future weeks of chores
